### Security Measures

#### **API Hosting and Encryption**

*   **Cloudflare Serverless Environment**: All **2Factor API endpoints** are hosted on Cloudflare's serverless environment for scalability.

*   **End-to-End Encryption**: Cloudflare employs **SSL/TLS encryption** to ensure secure transmission of data between the client, Cloudflare, and 2Factor's backend systems.

#### **Threat Intelligence and Protection**

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Cloudflare???s WAF protects publicly accessible API endpoints from vulnerabilities and unauthorized access attempts.

    *   **Rule Set**: Protects against thousands of commonly known web exploits and intrusion attempts.

    *   **IP-Based Restrictions**: Backend systems enforce strict IP-based access controls to block unintended audiences.

#### **Brute Force and Local Firewall Protection**

*   Each Linux virtual machine (VM) hosting code and data stores is secured with:

    *   A **local firewall**.

    *   **Brute-force monitoring software** to detect and prevent unauthorized login attempts.

#### **Logging and Monitoring**

*   Random checks are conducted to monitor access attempts to data stores or VMs from unauthorized IPs, ensuring continuous oversight of system security.

* * *

### Additional Security Features for Clients

#### **IP-Based Access Control**

*   **Client-Specific IP Restrictions**: Clients can enforce IP-based restrictions on their API accounts to prevent unauthorized use.

* * *

### Data Retention and Disposal Policies

#### **Data Retention**

*   **Banking Clients**: Data is retained for **7 years**, as required by industry regulations.

*   **Other Clients**: Data is typically retained for **1 year**, after which it is archived in flat files.

#### **Data Archival and Disposal**
